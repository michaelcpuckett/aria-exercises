</main>

<!-- Explanation:
  * The first <p> element is styled to look like a heading, but it is not
    marked up as a heading.
  * Screen reader users navigate web pages by headings, so it is important to
    include headings and mark them up properly.
  * Use a heading element (<h1>-<h6>) whenever possible. The heading level
    should reflect the importance of the heading within the document structure.
  * role=heading is an alternative to using a heading element, in case the
    heading is styled in a way that makes it difficult to use a heading element.
