<!-- Explanation:
  * The first image is a decorative image, so it does not need to be exposed
    to screen readers. It should have a role="presentation" attribute or an
    empty alt attribute.
  * The second image is a meaningful image, so it should have an alt attribute.
  * The alt attribute should describe the image in a way that makes sense in
    context.
