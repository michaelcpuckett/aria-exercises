<!-- Original markup: -->

<section aria-label="Modal dialog">
  <h2>Warning!</h2>
  <p>Your changes will not be saved.</p>
  <button type="button">Cancel</button>
  <button type="button">OK</button>
</section>

<!-- Corrected markup: -->

<dialog
  role="alertdialog"
  aria-labelledby="dialog-title"
  aria-describedby="dialog-content"
>
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Warning!</h2>
  <p id="dialog-content">Your changes will not be saved.</p>
  <button type="button">Cancel</button>
  <button type="button">OK</button>
</dialog>

<!-- Explanation:
  * The <section> element is not the correct element to use for a modal dialog.
  * Use the <dialog> element instead.
  * The <dialog> element should have a role of "alertdialog" to indicate that it
    is a modal dialog that requires user attention.
  * The <dialog> element should have an aria-labelledby attribute that points to
    the title of the dialog.
  * The <dialog> element should have an aria-describedby attribute that points
    to the content of the dialog.
  * Opening a <dialog> element with JavaScript gets you many accessibility
    features for free, such as trapping focus within the dialog, and preventing
    interaction with elements outside the dialog.
